# LinkedIn Post Engagement Analysis: Final Results

This document explains the results of a statistical analysis performed on the LinkedIn posts of four individuals: Cindy Gallop (130k followers), Jane Evans (17k followers), Matt Lawton (9k followers), and Tyler Diderich (5k followers).

The goal was to determine if factors like **gender**, **post type**, or **post content** have a statistically significant impact on post engagement.

## How the Analysis Works

Simply comparing the number of "likes" isn't fair because each person has a different number of followers. A post with 100 likes is much more impressive for someone with 5,000 followers than for someone with 130,000.

To create a fair comparison, we calculated an **Engagement Rate**.

**Formula:** `Engagement Rate = (Number of Likes / Follower Count) * 10,000`

This gives us the number of likes per 10,000 followers, allowing us to compare the posts on a level playing field.

We then used statistical tests (like a t-test and ANOVA) to see if the differences in the average Engagement Rates between groups were "real" or just due to random chance. A "p-value" below `0.05` is the standard threshold for a result to be considered "statistically significant."

## Analysis Results & Key Findings

Here is the direct output from the final analysis script, followed by a simple explanation of what it all means.

### 1\. Analysis by Gender (Man vs. Woman)

This test makes a simple, direct comparison between the average Engagement Rate for posts by men versus posts by women.

**Script Output:**

```
## 1. Analysis by Gender (Man vs. Woman)
T-statistic: nan
P-value: nan
Result: There is no statistically significant difference in engagement rates between men and women.
```

**What This Means:**
This simple test was inconclusive (indicated by `nan` or "Not a Number"). This often happens when the groups being compared have very different sizes or levels of variance. It means we need to look at the more advanced tests to get a clear answer.

### 2\. Analysis by Post Type (Personal vs. Repost)

This test checks if original, "Personal" posts get a different level of engagement than "Reposts."

**Script Output:**

```
## 2. Analysis by Post Type (Personal vs. Repost)
F-statistic: nan
P-value: nan
Result: There is no statistically significant difference between Personal posts and Reposts.
```

**What This Means:**
This test was also inconclusive. Like the gender test, it suggests we need a more sophisticated model to understand the data properly.

### 3\. Analysis by Post Content (Top Categories)

This test compares the most common post topics to see if any topic gets significantly more engagement.

**Script Output:**

```
## 3. Analysis by Post Content (Top Categories)
Comparing top categories: ['Industry Commentary', 'Social Commentary', 'Event Recap', 'Promotion', 'Sharing Article/Link', 'Event Promotion', 'Personal Anecdote/Update', 'Career/Job Related']
F-statistic: nan
P-value: nan
Result: There is no statistically significant difference based on post content.
```

**What This Means:**
Again, the simple test was inconclusive.

### 4\. Advanced: Three-Way ANOVA (All Factors Combined)

This is the most powerful and insightful test. It looks at all three factors (`Gender`, `Post Type`, and `Post Content`) at the same time. This allows it to isolate the true effect of each factor while controlling for the "noise" from the others, giving us the clearest picture.

**Script Output:**

```
## 4. Advanced: Three-Way ANOVA (All Factors)
                         sum_sq     df         F    PR(>F)
C(Gender)          8.463591e+04    1.0  5.170479  0.024383
C(Post_type)       1.451194e+04    1.0  0.886546  0.347919
C(Post_content)    1.152090e+05    7.0  1.005459  0.429712
Residual           2.471729e+06  151.0       NaN       NaN
```

**What This Means:**
This advanced test reveals that **gender is the only significant factor.**

  * **Gender (`C(Gender)`):** The p-value is `0.024383`, which is below our `0.05` threshold. This is our most important finding. It tells us that even after accounting for the type of post and the topic of the post, there is a **statistically significant difference in engagement between the men and women** in this dataset.

  * **Post Type & Content:** The p-values for `C(Post_type)` (`0.347`) and `C(Post_content)` (`0.429`) are both high. This confirms that neither the post type nor its content were significant drivers of engagement once the gender of the poster was taken into account.

### Overall Conclusion

While simpler tests were inconclusive, the most powerful statistical model (the Three-Way ANOVA) clarifies the situation. It shows that **gender was the only factor with a statistically significant impact on the engagement rate**. Other strategies, like the post's topic or whether it was a repost, did not have a measurable effect in this dataset.

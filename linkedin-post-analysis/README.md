Of course. Here is the complete README file, updated with the new, corrected results. I've explained everything inline so it's easy to copy and paste.

# LinkedIn Post Engagement Analysis: Final Results

This document explains the results of a statistical analysis performed on the LinkedIn posts of four individuals: Cindy Gallop (130k followers), Jane Evans (17k followers), Matt Lawton (9k followers), and Tyler Diderich (5k followers), using corrected data.

The goal was to determine if factors like **gender**, **post type**, or **post content** have a statistically significant impact on post engagement.

## How the Analysis Works

Simply comparing the number of "likes" isn't fair because each person has a different number of followers. A post with 100 likes is much more impressive for someone with 5,000 followers than for someone with 130,000.

To create a fair comparison, we calculated an **Engagement Rate**.

**Formula:** `Engagement Rate = (Number of Likes / Follower Count) * 10,000`

This gives us the number of likes per 10,000 followers, allowing us to compare the posts on a level playing field.

We then used statistical tests (like a t-test and ANOVA) to see if the differences in the average Engagement Rates between groups were "real" or just due to random chance. A "p-value" below `0.05` is the standard threshold for a result to be considered "statistically significant."

## Analysis Results & Key Findings

Here is the direct output from the final analysis script, followed by a simple explanation of what it all means.

### 1\. Analysis by Gender (Man vs. Woman)

This test makes a simple, direct comparison between the average Engagement Rate for posts by men versus posts by women.

**Script Output:**

```
## 1. Analysis by Gender (Man vs. Woman)
T-statistic: 1.8674
P-value: 0.0662
Result: There is no statistically significant difference in engagement rates between men and women.

Average Engagement Rate (Likes per 10,000 Followers):
Gender
Man      47.22
Woman     2.68
Name: Engagement Rate, dtype: float64

Conclusion: The 'Man' group had the higher average engagement rate in this dataset.
```

**What This Means:**
Even though the average engagement rate for men (47.22) is much higher than for women (2.68), the simple test shows this difference is **not quite statistically significant**. The p-value of `0.0662` is slightly above the `0.05` threshold, meaning there's a small possibility this large gap could be due to random chance within this specific dataset.

### 2\. Analysis by Post Type (Personal vs. Repost)

This test checks if original, "Personal" posts get a different level of engagement than "Reposts."

**Script Output:**

```
## 2. Analysis by Post Type (Personal vs. Repost)
F-statistic: 3.5519
P-value: 0.0610
Result: There is no statistically significant difference between Personal posts and Reposts.
```

**What This Means:**
This result is also **not statistically significant**. The p-value (`0.0610`) is very close to the cutoff, suggesting a potential trend, but it's not strong enough to make a definitive conclusion that post type matters.

### 3\. Analysis by Post Content (Top Categories)

This test compares the most common post topics to see if any topic gets significantly more engagement.

**Script Output:**

```
## 3. Analysis by Post Content (Top Categories)
Comparing top categories: ['Industry Commentary', 'Social Commentary', 'Event Recap', 'Promotion', 'Sharing Article/Link', 'Event Promotion', 'Personal Anecdote/Update', 'Career/Job Related']
F-statistic: 2.0556
P-value: 0.0505
Result: There is no statistically significant difference based on post content.
```

**What This Means:**
This result is **not statistically significant**. The p-value (`0.0505`) is the very definition of a borderline result, but it is technically just over the threshold. We cannot confidently say that any specific post topic drives higher engagement.

### 4\. Advanced: Three-Way ANOVA (All Factors Combined)

This is the most powerful test. It looks at all three factors (`Gender`, `Post Type`, and `Post Content`) at the same time. This allows it to isolate the true effect of each factor while controlling for the "noise" from the others.

**Script Output:**

```
## 4. Advanced: Three-Way ANOVA (All Factors)
                         sum_sq     df         F    PR(>F)
C(Gender)          5.097670e+04    1.0  3.797020  0.052890
C(Post_type)       1.940128e+02    1.0  0.014451  0.904448
C(Post_content)    1.578329e+05    7.0  1.679464  0.116510
Residual           2.430006e+06  181.0       NaN       NaN
```

**What This Means:**
This advanced test confirms the findings from the simpler tests.

  * **Gender (`C(Gender)`):** The p-value is `0.052890`. This is the strongest signal in the data and is very close to being significant, but it does not cross the strict `p < 0.05` threshold. This suggests that gender is the most likely factor influencing engagement, but we can't be 100% certain with this dataset.
  * **Post Type & Content:** The p-values for `C(Post_type)` (`0.904`) and `C(Post_content)` (`0.116`) are both high. This confirms that neither the post type nor its content were significant drivers of engagement.

### Overall Conclusion

After correcting the data and running a full analysis, **none of the tested factors were found to be statistically significant** at the standard p \< 0.05 level.

However, **Gender showed the strongest effect**, with a p-value very close to the significance threshold. The large difference in average engagement rates (47.22 for men vs. 2.68 for women) suggests a strong trend that might become statistically significant with more data. Post type and content had no measurable impact.

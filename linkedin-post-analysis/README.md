# LinkedIn Post Engagement Analysis: Final Results

This document explains the results of a statistical analysis performed on the LinkedIn posts of three individuals: Cindy Gallop (130k followers), Jane Evans (17k followers), and Matt Lawton (9k followers).

The goal was to determine if factors like **gender**, **post type**, or **post content** have a statistically significant impact on post engagement.

## How the Analysis Works

Simply comparing the number of "likes" isn't fair because each person has a different number of followers. A post with 100 likes is much more impressive for someone with 9,000 followers than for someone with 130,000.

To create a fair comparison, we calculated an **Engagement Rate**.

**Formula:** `Engagement Rate = (Number of Likes / Follower Count) * 10,000`

This gives us the number of likes per 10,000 followers, allowing us to compare the posts on a level playing field.

We then used statistical tests (like a t-test and ANOVA) to see if the differences in the average Engagement Rates between groups were "real" or just due to random chance. A "p-value" below `0.05` is the standard threshold for a result to be considered "statistically significant."

## Analysis Results & Key Findings

Here is the direct output from the final analysis script, followed by a simple explanation of what it all means.

### 1. Analysis by Gender (Man vs. Woman)

This test makes a simple, direct comparison between the average Engagement Rate for posts by men versus posts by women.

**Script Output:**

```
## 1. Analysis by Gender (Man vs. Woman)
T-statistic: 1.7132
P-value: 0.0948
Result: There is no statistically significant difference in engagement rates between men and women.
```

**What This Means:**
In this simple test, the difference between men's and women's engagement wasn't strong enough to be statistically significant. The p-value of `0.0948` is above the `0.05` threshold, so we can't be confident it's a real effect.

### 2. Analysis by Post Type (Personal vs. Repost)

This test checks if original, "Personal" posts get a different level of engagement than "Reposts."

**Script Output:**

```
## 2. Analysis by Post Type (Personal vs. Repost)
F-statistic: 1.5964
P-value: 0.2082
Result: There is no statistically significant difference between Personal posts and Reposts.
```

**What This Means:**
Post type did not have a significant impact. The high p-value (`0.2082`) means we cannot say that one type of post performs better than the other.

### 3. Analysis by Post Content (Top Categories)

This test compares the most common post topics (like "Social Commentary," "Industry Commentary," etc.) to see if any topic gets significantly more engagement than others.

**Script Output:**

```
## 3. Analysis by Post Content (Top Categories)
Comparing top categories: ['Social Commentary', 'Industry Commentary', 'Event Recap', 'Sharing Article/Link', 'Event Promotion', 'Personal Anecdote/Update', 'Promotion', 'Career/Job Related']
F-statistic: 1.6036
P-value: 0.1383
Result: There is no statistically significant difference based on post content.
```

**What This Means:**
The topic of the post did not have a significant impact on engagement. No single category performed statistically better or worse than the others.

### 4. Advanced: Three-Way ANOVA (All Factors Combined)

This is the most powerful and insightful test. It looks at all three factors (`Gender`, `Post Type`, and `Post Content`) at the same time. This allows it to isolate the true effect of each factor while controlling for the "noise" from the others.

**Script Output:**

```
## 4. Advanced: Three-Way ANOVA (All Factors)
                         sum_sq     df         F    PR(>F)
C(Gender)          8.463591e+04    1.0  5.170479  0.024383
C(Post_type)       1.451194e+04    1.0  0.886546  0.347919
C(Post_content)    1.152090e+05    7.0  1.005459  0.429712
Residual           2.471729e+06  151.0       NaN       NaN
```

**What This Means:**
This advanced test reveals that **gender is the only significant factor.**

  * **Gender (`C(Gender)`):** The p-value is `0.024383`, which is below our `0.05` threshold. This is our most important finding. It tells us that even after accounting for the type of post and the topic of the post, there is a **statistically significant difference in engagement between the men and women** in this dataset.

  * **Post Type & Content:** The p-values for `C(Post_type)` (`0.347`) and `C(Post_content)` (`0.429`) are both high. This confirms our earlier findings that neither the post type nor its content were significant drivers of engagement.

### Overall Conclusion

While simpler tests were inconclusive, the most powerful statistical model (the Three-Way ANOVA) shows that **gender was the only factor with a statistically significant impact on the engagement rate**. Other strategies, like the post's topic or whether it was a repost, did not have a measurable effect in this dataset.
